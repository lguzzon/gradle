### More work avoidance when using `@Classpath` task properties

For built-in and custom tasks that use the `@Classpath` annotation, Gradle now performs deeper inspection of the classpath to filter out some differences that do not affect task execution.  Gradle will ignore changes to timestamps within a jar file and the order of entries inside a jar file.
 
In previous versions, for tasks like `Javadoc`, `Checkstyle` and `Test`, Gradle would consider the task out-of-date if the content of the classpath changed in any way (order of classes in a jar, timestamps of class files, etc). 

### Extensions now have a public type

Extensions can now be registered in `ExtensionContainer`s with an explicit public type.
 This allows plugin authors to hide their implementation type from build scripts and
 allow `ExtensionContainer`s to expose a schema of all the registered extensions.

For example, if you have a `FancyExtension` type, implemented by some `DefaultFancyExtension` type, here is how
 you should register it:

    // If you want to delegate the extension instance creation to Gradle:
    project.extensions.create FancyExtension, 'fancy', DefaultFancyExtension

    // Or if you need to create the extension instance yourself:
    FancyExtension fancyInstance = new DefaultFancyExtension(...)
    project.extensions.add FancyExtension, 'fancy', fancyInstance

### Public type for representing lazily evaluated properties

Because Gradle's build lifecycle clearly distinguishes between configuration phase and execution phase the evaluation of property
 values has to be deferred under certain conditions to properly capture end user input. A typical use case is the mapping of
 extension properties to custom task properties as part of a plugin implementation. In the past, many plugin developers were forced to solve evaluation order problems by using the concept of convention mapping, an internal API in Gradle subject to change.
 
This release of Gradle introduces a mutable type to the public API representing a property with state. The relevant interface is called [`PropertyState`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/provider/PropertyState.html). An instance of this type can be created through the method [`Project.property(Class)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/Project.html#property-java.lang.Class-).

The following example demonstrates how to use the property state API to map an extension property to a custom task property without
running into evaluation ordering issues:

    apply plugin: GreetingPlugin
    
    greeting {
        message = 'Hi from Gradle'
        outputFiles = files('a.txt', 'b.txt')
    }
    
    class GreetingPlugin implements Plugin<Project> {
        void apply(Project project) {
            // Add the 'greeting' extension object
            def extension = project.extensions.create('greeting', GreetingPluginExtension, project)
            // Add a task that uses the configuration
            project.tasks.create('hello', Greeting) {
                message = extension.messageProvider
                outputFiles = extension.outputFiles
            }
        }
    }
    
    class GreetingPluginExtension {
        final PropertyState<String> message
        final ConfigurableFileCollection outputFiles
    
        GreetingPluginExtension(Project project) {
            message = project.property(String)
            setMessage('Hello from GreetingPlugin')
            outputFiles = project.files()
        }
    
        String getMessage() {
            message.get()
        }
    
        Provider<String> getMessageProvider() {
            message
        }
    
        void setMessage(String message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }
    
        FileCollection getOutputFiles() {
            outputFiles
        }
    
        void setOutputFiles(FileCollection outputFiles) {
            this.outputFiles.setFrom(outputFiles)
        }
    }
    
    class Greeting extends DefaultTask {
        final PropertyState<String> message = project.property(String)
        final ConfigurableFileCollection outputFiles = project.files()
    
        @Input
        String getMessage() {
            message.get()
        }
    
        void setMessage(String message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }
    
        void setMessage(Provider<String> message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }
    
        FileCollection getOutputFiles() {
            outputFiles
        }
    
        void setOutputFiles(FileCollection outputFiles) {
            this.outputFiles.setFrom(outputFiles)
        }
    
        @TaskAction
        void printMessage() {
            getOutputFiles().each {
                it.text = getMessage()
            }
        }
    }

### BuildActionExecutor supports running tasks

Tooling API clients can now run tasks before running a build action. This allows them to fetch tooling models which depend on the result of
executing some task. This mirrors the existing `ModelBuilder.forTasks()` API.

### Support for multi-value Javadoc options

Gradle has added support for command-line options to doclets that can appear [multiple times and have multiple values](javadoc/org/gradle/external/javadoc/CoreJavadocOptions.html#addMultilineMultiValueOption-java.lang.String-).

In previous versions of Gradle, it was not possible to supply command-line options like:

    -myoption 'foo' 'bar'
    -myoption 'baz'
    
Gradle would produce a single `-myoption` or combine the option's value into a single argument.

    javadoc {
        options {
            def myoption = addMultilineMultiValueOption("myoption")
            myoption.setValue([
                [ "foo", "bar" ],
                [ "baz" ]
            ])
        }
    }

### Default Zinc compiler upgraded from 0.3.7 to 0.3.13
This will take advantage of performance optimizations in the latest [Zinc](https://github.com/typesafehub/zinc) releases.
